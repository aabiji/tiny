Hackernews dark theme
---------------------
I spent an hour or so tweaking css values for hackernews and came up with something nice.
This is the repo behind the Hackernews dark theme extension : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hackernews-dark-theme/
I like it, and I hope you do too.
